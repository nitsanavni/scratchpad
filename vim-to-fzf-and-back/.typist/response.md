To modify the script to output all the items left in the filtered down list, we need to adjust how `fzf` is being used within the script. Typically, `fzf` is meant for selecting a single item, but it can be configured to output multiple or all remaining items. Let's assume the functionality adjustment involves enabling multi-select mode in `fzf`.

changes required: Allow output of all items in the filtered list using multi-select.

### File: `./fzf_output_the_filtered_down_list.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Original command to run fzf
# selected=$(fzf)

# Update the command to use the '--multi' option for multi-selection
selected=$(fzf --multi)

# Output all selected items, or, if none are selected, all filtered items
echo "$selected"
```

This script now uses the `--multi` option with `fzf`, allowing you to select multiple items or all remaining items in the list. When you make selections and press Enter, all selected items are outputted.
