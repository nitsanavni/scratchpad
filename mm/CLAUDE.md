# TDD Instructions

- Use `bun test` to run tests
- Follow test-driven development approach: write tests first, then implement
- Test files should be named `*.test.ts`
- Don't mention TDD explicitly in commit messages

# Development Workflow

- Commit and push very often
- Use prettier for code formatting: `bunx prettier --write .`
- Consider setting up prettier as git hook
